Testing workflow for:
Collecting data from `worldfootballr` package
Write data to a csv
csv used for a visualization in tableau
tableau workbook embedded in blog post


Some questions to answer in viz
* Which teams under/overperformed xg at home, away, combined
* Related to league position?

Need to combine match results with season data for final set with:

Team, league rank, w, d l, points total, points home, points away, home goals sum, home xg sum, goals - xg home,
away goals, away xg, goals - xg, away, total goals, total xg, goals - xg total

In Tableau goal is to create a parameterized visualisation where the user can choose which fields to plot along the x & y axes
